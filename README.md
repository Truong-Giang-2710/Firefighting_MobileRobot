# 🔥 Firefighting Mobile Robot

This is my invidiual project which is a smart mobile robot capable of detecting fire using computer vision and AI, navigating towards the flame, and extinguishing it. It is designed for fire hazard simulation and educational purposes.

 💡 Features
- 🔍 **Fire Detection via AI**: Uses image processing and a lightweight deep learning model (CNN or YOLO) to detect flames in real time.
- 🎯 **PID-Controlled DC Motors**: Ensures smooth and accurate movement using PID algorithm for motor speed and direction control.
- 🚗 **Autonomous Navigation**: Automatically approaches the fire source using camera feedback and obstacle avoidance sensors.
- 📷 **Camera Module**: Captures live video input for AI-based fire recognition.
- 🧠 **Embedded System**: Built on Raspberry Pi and STM32 microcontroller for real-time processing and control.
